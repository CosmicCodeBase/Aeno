## Hey 👋️

Hello there, my name is Hariienesh. I have an unwavering passion for technology, and I find great joy in the world of coding. It has become more than just a hobby for me; it's a part of who I am. I particularly hold a deep appreciation for Linux and proudly proclaim my usage of Fedora. My interests lie in the captivating realm of cybersecurity, where I enjoy engaging in malware analysis and solving CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges. Currently based in Malaysia, I am a motivated teen seeking to explore and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology.
